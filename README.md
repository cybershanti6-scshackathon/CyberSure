# 🔎 Problem Overview

Network security environments often contain devices and configurations from different vendors. Security teams may need to manually inspect configurations, understand vendor-specific settings, compare them against security requirements, and prepare reports.

This creates several practical challenges:

- Vendor-specific configuration formats
- Manual security assessment
- Difficulty maintaining consistent compliance checks
- Time-consuming interpretation of technical findings
- Separate reporting workflows
- Limited security expertise in smaller organizations

The **NTRO Problem Statement 26155** calls for an **AI-Driven Multi-Vendor Network Security Compliance Auditor**, including capabilities such as vendor-specific processing, automated security/compliance assessment, and dynamic reporting.

---

# 💡 Our Solution

**CyberSure** brings these activities into a single workflow.

Instead of manually checking every configuration, the platform accepts security-related inputs/configurations, processes them through modular scanners, evaluates the relevant security conditions, and presents the results through a centralized dashboard.

The platform also uses AI-assisted explanations to make technical findings easier to understand and provides report generation for assessment results.

# 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Vendor Security Assessment

CyberSure is designed to process security information from different network/security vendors through a common assessment workflow.

The architecture supports vendor-specific processing and normalization so that the assessment logic can work on a consistent internal representation.

### 2. Modular Security Scanners

Security checks are separated into scanner modules instead of putting every check into one large function.

This makes the system easier to:

- Extend
- Test
- Maintain
- Add new controls to
- Add vendor-specific checks

### 3. Compliance-Oriented Analysis

Findings can be mapped against relevant security controls and benchmarks, including references such as:

- CIS Benchmarks
- NIST SP 800-53
- DISA STIGs
- ISO/IEC 27001
- Vendor-specific security guidance

> The prototype provides compliance-oriented assessment and mapping. It should not be interpreted as a formal certification or official compliance certificate.

### 4. Risk-Oriented Results

The dashboard presents security findings in a form that allows users to identify issues requiring attention and understand the associated remediation direction.

### 5. AI-Assisted Explanation

CyberSure uses an AI layer to translate technical security findings into more understandable explanations and recommended remediation guidance.

A deterministic fallback can be used where an AI response is unavailable.

### 6. Dynamic PDF Reporting

The reporting module generates assessment reports from scan results.

The report can include information such as:

- Device/vendor information
- Model and software/version information where available
- Security findings
- Assessment results
- Risk information
- Recommended remediation
- Overall assessment information

### 7. Centralized Dashboard

The web interface brings the major assessment modules together in one place.

Current prototype modules include:

- Dashboard
- Devices & Vendors
- Network/Endpoint Security
- Risk & Policy Protection
- Web Security
- AI Assistant
- Reports

---

# 🔄 System Workflow

CyberSure follows the following high-level workflow:

### Step 1 — Input

The user provides supported security information such as:

- Vendor configuration
- Device details
- Network information
- Domain/security inputs
- Security assessment parameters

### Step 2 — Normalize

Vendor-specific information is converted into a common structure wherever required.

### Step 3 — Scan

Modular security scanners evaluate the relevant inputs.

### Step 4 — Analyze

The results are processed to identify security findings and assessment conditions.

### Step 5 — Compliance Mapping

Applicable findings are associated with relevant security controls/benchmarks.

### Step 6 — Risk Explanation

The platform presents the technical issue and provides AI-assisted explanation/remediation guidance.

### Step 7 — Report

The final assessment can be converted into a structured PDF report.

# 🔌 Multi-Vendor Approach

A key requirement of the problem statement is handling multiple vendors.

CyberSure therefore follows a modular approach:

```text
Vendor A Configuration ──┐
                         │
Vendor B Configuration ──┼──► Normalization ──► Common Assessment Logic
                         │
Vendor C Configuration ──┘
```

Vendor-specific processing is kept separate from the common assessment workflow wherever possible.

This allows the platform to be extended with additional vendors without redesigning the complete application.

---

# 🛡️ Security & Compliance Analysis

CyberSure can organize security checks around recognized security references and vendor guidance.

### Reference categories

| Reference | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **CIS Benchmarks** | Secure configuration guidance |
| **NIST SP 800-53** | Security and privacy control reference |
| **DISA STIGs** | Security configuration guidance |
| **ISO/IEC 27001** | Information security management reference |
| **Vendor-specific guidance** | Vendor/device-specific security checks |

The assessment output focuses on identifying configuration/security issues and providing remediation-oriented information.

---

# 🤖 AI-Assisted Risk Explanation

Security scanner output can be technical and difficult for non-specialist users to interpret.

CyberSure adds an AI-assisted layer to help explain:

```text
Technical Finding
       ↓
Why does this matter?
       ↓
Potential Security Impact
       ↓
Recommended Remediation
```

The AI layer is intended to improve the usability of security findings rather than replace the underlying deterministic security checks.

### Example

```text
Finding:
HTTP service exposure detected

AI-assisted explanation:
The service may expose traffic without transport encryption.

Recommendation:
Review whether HTTPS/TLS should be enabled and whether
unencrypted HTTP access is required.
```

---

# 📄 Dynamic Reporting

Reporting is a core part of the requested solution.

CyberSure generates reports from the **actual assessment output** instead of relying only on a fixed static document.

Conceptually:

```text
Device Information
       +
Software / Version
       +
Scanner Results
       +
Compliance Findings
       +
Risk Information
       +
Remediation
       ↓
Dynamic Report Generation
       ↓
PDF Assessment Report
```

The report-generation component is implemented in Python and can use libraries such as **ReportLab/FPDF** depending on the project configuration.

# ⚠️ Prototype Scope & Limitations

CyberSure is an **SIH prototype** and should be evaluated according to the functionality implemented in the submitted version.

Important limitations may include:

- Scanner coverage is limited to the checks implemented in the prototype.
- Vendor support depends on the implemented vendor modules.
- AI-generated explanations should be reviewed by a qualified security professional before operational use.
- Compliance mapping in the prototype does not constitute legal certification or formal third-party certification.
- Non-intrusive scanning should be used only on systems for which the user has authorization.
- Production deployment would require additional authentication, authorization, secure secret management, logging, monitoring, testing, and infrastructure hardening.

---

# 🔮 Future Scope

Potential future development includes:

- Additional network/security vendors
- Expanded security control coverage
- Continuous configuration monitoring
- Scheduled compliance assessments
- Role-based access control
- Enterprise authentication
- Centralized audit logs
- Cloud deployment
- SIEM/SOC integrations
- More advanced risk prioritization
- Expanded AI-assisted remediation
- Automated configuration remediation with explicit authorization
